# PKCP - Public-Key Chaining Protocol

Bitcoin-based public-key chaining protocol for self-sovereign digital identity management. Anyone using any system that relies on public-private key pairs to uniquely identify users can publish the public keys as inscriptions on a satoshi and thus link them into one identity.

No issuer, no certificate authority, no personal details. Your keys are in your hands.

## Specification

The Bitcoin blockchain is used as a distributed public-key store.

A certificate is a public-private key pair.

An identity is a chain of consecutive public keys inscribed on the same satoshi. The inscribed satoshi is the cornerstone of the identity, a cornersat. 

The [Ordinals Protocol](https://docs.ordinals.com/) is used to inscribe the satoshi, read the inscription content, and keep track of the cornerstone satoshi by its ordinal number or name. Inscriptions are permanent and immutable. This protocol leverages the mostly ignored fact that each satoshi can be [inscribed multiple times](https://docs.ordinals.com/inscriptions.html#reinscriptions).

The controller is the entity in charge of the identity and can be an individual or an organization. The controller holds the keys of a non-empty Bitcoin wallet.


### Publish and rotate keys

To publish an identity, the controller first creates a certificate and then an inscription on a satoshi. 
The inscription must contain plain text content, where the content is a string, containing the identityâ€™s public key in the format:
```
pkcp:<public key>
```

To rotate the certificate, the controller creates a new key pair, and then inscribes the latest public key on the same satoshi using the same syntax as above.

When a new inscription is added, the previous certificate becomes read-only. No new records can be created with the previous, read-only certificate. 
This means that all records created with any previous key can still be validated and they all contribute to the history of the identity. 


### Deprecate

To permanently deprecate an identity, publish an inscription in the format:
```
pkcp:d
```

A grace period of 48 hrs is granted to re-enable the identity with a new public key. If the grace period is exceeded, any further keys are ignored.
